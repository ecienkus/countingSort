# Counting Sort

In this repository I have writen a Counting Sort Algorithm that is very similar to GeeksForGeeks's
code for Counting Sort. I wasn't trying to come up with my own way to write this algorithm I was 
originally just trying to use it and understand how it works. 

This repository is very straight forward. All of Counting Sort code is in main.cpp in the function called countingSort.

The set up is pretty self explanatory. In main() there is a vector called vect where I make the dataset to be sorted. 
Everything works after you run the code and the vector will be sorted from smallest to largest via Counting Sort. 

If you are confused how this sorting algorithm works I have writen an article on Medium going through the 
algorithm and how it works. The link to that article is here https://ecienkus-84388.medium.com/counting-sort-1995f1c70440
